# Nigeria TB/HIV Performance Dashboard (2010–2023)

This project analyzes 13 years of Nigeria's HIV and TB data using **Microsoft Excel**, with a focus on understanding testing trends, treatment gaps, and the care cascade. The dataset was sourced from the **World Health Organization (WHO)** global TB/HIV surveillance data.

## 📌 Objective

To extract and analyze Nigeria-specific records from a global dataset and present them in an interactive Excel dashboard that highlights key trends and public health insights.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Over 1.9 million individuals were notified** for TB/HIV between 2010 and 2023.
- **Testing rates improved significantly** from 2019 onward.
- Only **7% of those notified** are recorded as receiving **ART (treatment)**, revealing a critical treatment gap.
- The **care cascade** visualization shows major drop-offs from diagnosis to treatment, highlighting the need for stronger linkage-to-care systems.
